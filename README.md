### About This Project

An app designed to show the current weather and 5 day forecast for a city specified by the user. 

The data is dynamically put on the page, using a weather api and 3 different urls for that api. Once the needed data is grabbed, the app then updates the page with the new information. Local storage is used to keep buttons of previously searched cities on the page, and when the page is refreshed the data will reset to the most recent clicked city button.
